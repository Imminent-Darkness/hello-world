# hello-world
First journey into GitHub..
#
# Hello there!
#
# I am very green when it comes to writing code. I only started
# a little less than a year ago, but I can't seem to stop. It's
# become quite an obsession! I pretty much dropped everything and
# enrolled in school, and I'm still playing with it in my free time.
# I really hope to learn a lot from this community and maybe get a
# chance to work on some amazing things with you all in the near future!
#
# Thanks for letting me play along!
